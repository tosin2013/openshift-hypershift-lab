## Portworx Multipathing

This section provides instructions for configuring your environment to use FlashArray as backend storage for Kubernetes applications, including both single-tenant and multi-tenant setups.

See [the Portworx docs](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/platform/openshift/ocp-flasharray/install-flasharray/install-with-px-storev2#configure-the-multipathconf-file) for more information.

This directory does not have a `kustomization.yaml` file as the files are intended to be placed in the install machine config directory at install time rather than post-provisioning.
